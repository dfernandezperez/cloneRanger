# TotalSeq sequences, read location and fastq file (R1 or R2)
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Sequence and pattern of totalseq or a different method used for cell hashing.
# https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/using/multi#samples
# The information required is the sequence of the barcode, the sample to which it corresponds and barcode location in read
# Example --> cellhash-name : ["Sample1", "R2", "5P(BC)"", "ACCCACCAGTAAGAC"]
# If there is not cellhashing data in the libraries the "barcode" field can be filled, the only that has to be empty is the
# assignments. Example:
#  TotalSeqMouse1: ["R2", "5PNNNNNNNNNN(BC)", "ACCCACCAGTAAGAC"]

barcodes:
  TotalSeqMouse1: ["R2", "5PNNNNNNNNNN(BC)", "ACCCACCAGTAAGAC"]
  TotalSeqMouse2: ["R2", "5PNNNNNNNNNN(BC)", "GGTCGAGAGCATTCA"]
  TotalSeqMouse3: ["R2", "5PNNNNNNNNNN(BC)", "CTTGCCGCATGTCAT"]
  TotalSeqMouse4: ["R2", "5PNNNNNNNNNN(BC)", "AAAGCATTCTTCACG"]
  TotalSeqMouse5: ["R2", "5PNNNNNNNNNN(BC)", "CTTTGTCTTTGTGAG"]
  TotalSeqMouse6: ["R2", "5PNNNNNNNNNN(BC)", "TATGCTGCCACGGTA"]
  TotalSeqMouse7: ["R2", "5PNNNNNNNNNN(BC)", "GAGTCTGCCAGTATC"]
  TotalSeqMouse8: ["R2", "5PNNNNNNNNNN(BC)", "TATAGAACGCCAGGC"]


# TotalSeq sample metadata
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Here you have to write the cellhashing Ab ID that corresponds to every sample.
# The Ab ID are those defined previosly in "barcodes". The structure has to be the following:
# sample_id (from units.tsv):
#   Ab-Id: subsample_id (the one you like)
# "subsample_id" will be used as the new sample name, which will appear in the seurat object.
# Example:
  # sample1:
  #   TotalSeqMouse1: "sample1-rep1"
  #   TotalSeqMouse3: "sample1-rep2"
